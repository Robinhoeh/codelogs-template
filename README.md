# codelogs-template
A template repository for your own codelogs.

## What is a codelog?

A codelog is a log of the tasks I am planning on completing, the tasks I have
completed, the problems I faced, the solutions I found and the resources I
discovered in the process.

## Why do I log?

I log to keep track of the problems I encounter, so that I can find the
solution more quickly. I use it as a way to keep track of the resources I found
in a more orderly and context-dependent way than by simply saving it to my
bookmarks. I also use it as a notepad, to keep track of what I promised myself
I would have a look at later. Finally, I use it as a reflection tool, to
appreciate how much I have progressed and improved.

## How do I log?

I use the following template for weekly logs. Feel free to organise them as you
want within this repository.
